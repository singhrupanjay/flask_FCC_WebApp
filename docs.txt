-- so whenever we want to put a flask app into production we need to use gunicorn library

-- gunicorn library when installed it also adds a command called <gunicorn>. And this command needs to be given the name of the file that needs to be executed which is app.py

-- we also hav to specify the name of the actual variable which contains the flask application that we want to run
